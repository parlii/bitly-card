# Bitly Card

Created for the Bitly hack week in June 2022 by Parli, Jimmy, and Colin.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the Project

Bitly Card is a greenfield app for users to input a destination URL, generate a short link, and then display a beautiful customized page for sharing the link.

## Getting Started

First, clone the project to your local machine, then set up the dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```

Now you can run your local development server:

```bash√ò
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Please create a new branch (roughly following the Bitly workflow guidelines) for working on features.

### API Credentials

```env
BITLY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
```

You can generate an access token from the [Developer settings](https://app.bitly.com/settings/api/) in your Bitly account.
